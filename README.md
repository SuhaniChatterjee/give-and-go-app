## 🗺️ Maps & Routing

The system uses **OpenStreetMap** with the following features:

### Current Implementation (No API Key Required)
- Interactive map markers for donors and volunteers
- Route visualization using OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- Distance and ETA calculations
- Click-to-select location on map
- Address geocoding via Nominatim

### Optional: Google Maps Integration
To enable Google Maps features:

1. Get a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Geocoding API
   - Directions API
3. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

**Note**: The demo works perfectly without Google Maps. The free OpenStreetMap integration provides all core functionality.

## 📧 Notifications

### Current Setup (Demo Mode)
- In-app notification panel shows real-time updates
- Toast notifications for important events
- Simulated SMS notifications (logged to console)

### Production SMS Setup (Optional)
The app supports Twilio SMS notifications. To enable:

1. Sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Verify your domain and get credentials
3. The following secrets are already configured in Lovable Cloud:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

SMS notifications will automatically activate when Twilio credentials are present.

## 📄 PDF Receipt Generation

Completed donations automatically generate downloadable PDF receipts containing:
- Donation ID and timestamp
- Donor information
- Item details and category
- Pickup address and date
- Volunteer information
- Thank you message

Click "Download Receipt" on any completed donation to generate the PDF.

## 🗄️ Demo Data

### Pre-seeded Data
The system includes sample donations to demonstrate the workflow:

- **D-1001**: Pending donation (Clothing & Books)
- **D-1002**: Completed donation (Electronics) 
- **D-1003**: Assigned donation (Furniture)

### Creating New Demo Data
Simply use the donor account to schedule new donations, or sign up additional test accounts to explore the full system.
